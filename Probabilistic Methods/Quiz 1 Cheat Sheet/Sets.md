## Basics
* $B$ is a **subset** of $A$ if for any $\xi$ $\in$ $B$. $\xi$ is also in $A$.
$$
B \subseteq A
$$
* A set is **empty** if it contains no element.
$$
A=\emptyset .
$$
* The **universal set** is the set containing all elements of the sample space.
$$
A = \Omega
$$

## Set Operations
* The **union** of two sets $A$ and $B$ contains all elements in $A$ **or** $B$ .



* The **intersection** of two sets $A$ and $B$ contains all elements in $A$ **and** $B$.



* The **complement** of a set $A$ is the set containing all elements in $\Omega$ but **not** in $A$.



* The **difference** $A \backslash B$ is the set containing all elements in $A$ but **not** in $B$



- Two sets $A$ and $B$ are **disjoint** if 



- A collection of sets $\left\{A_1, \ldots, A_n\right\}$ is a **partition** of the universal set $\Omega$ if it is disjoint and if the union of all sets is the sample space $\Omega$.

## Set Properties
- **Commutative**: $A \cup B=B \cup A$ and $A \cap B=B \cap A$.

- **Associative**: $A \cup(B \cup C)=(A \cup B) \cup C$ and $A \cap(B \cap C)=(A \cap B) \cap C$.

- **Distributive**: $A \cup(B \cap C)=(A \cup B) \cap(A \cup C)$ and $A \cap(B \cup C)=$ $(A \cap B) \cup(A \cap C)$.

- **DeMorgan's Law**: $(A \cap B)^c=A^c \cup B^c$.
