## Charged Particles in Matter

### Net Charge

The net charge is the sum of the changes of all constituent particles. An object with net zero charge is "neutral". An object with non-zero net charge is "charged".

Think of net charge in the same way we did in chemistry. I.e. the net charge of a sodium ion, Na+ is +1.

$$ (+11e)+(-10e) = +e = +1.6 * 10^{-19}C$$
### Conservation of Charge

The net charge of a system plus its surroundings cannot change.

### Conductors and Insulators

* **Conductors** - Contain charged particles that can move easily through the material. Most metals such as copper, silver, iron, aluminum, and gold are good conductors. Aqueous salt solutions are also good conductors.
* **Insulators** - Materials where electrons are tightly bound to the atoms and there are no charged particles that can move through the material. Examples are wood, plastic, ceramic, etc...

## How Objects Become Charged

Many interactions in our daily lives are due to the interactions of charged objects. Balloons sticking to your head, lightweight charged objects seeming to move like magic. Objects can have a charge that is positive, neutral, or negative. Like charges repel, unlike charges attract.

### Protons Are Not Removed from Nuclei

Removing protons on transferring them would mean we are changing from one element to another, obviously that is not what we are doing, all changes in charge are due to a transfer of electrons.

### The Location of Charge Transfer

Suppose that two neutral strips of invisible tape are stuck together, then pulled quickly apart as shown below. Both pieces will become charged as a result of this process.


The net charge of the system must be zero so if the net charge of the upper piece of tape is $-1 nC$, then then the net charge of the lower piece of tape is $1nC$.

### How Much Charge Is on a Charged Object

Many objects can be charged, it is useful to know roughly how much charge they can carry, at least what order of magnitude.

## Polarization of Atoms

Why are charged objects attracted to neutral objects?

Charged objects cause the atoms in the neutral objects to polarize.

### The Structure of an Atom

An external charge can cause a shift in the position of the charges that make up a neutral atom or molecule.

Shown below is a picture of a Hydrogen atom.

If the electron cloud in an atom could be spherically uniform and always centered on the nucleus, as shown above, a neutral atom would have no interaction with an external charge. However, because the electron cloud is not rigidly connected to the nucleus, the center of the electron cloud and the nucleus can move relative to each other as shown below.

### Average Location of the Electron

These diagrams represent the probability of finding an electron in a position at any given time. It is important to remember that when the atom is polarized it does not mean that there will necessarily be more electrons on one side. It just means that at any given time you are more likely to find an electron on one side.

### Induced Dipoles are Created by Applied Electric Fields

Neutral atoms that are polarized to form a dipole are called induced dipoles. If the electric field that creates the dipole is removed the electron cloud will shift back to the center removing the induced dipole.

* An "induced dipole" is created when a neutral object is polarized by an applied electric field. The induced dipole will vanish if the applied field is removed
* A "permanent dipole" consists of two opposite charged separated by a fixed distance, such as $HCL$ or $H_2O$ molecules, or the dipole that can be constructed out of + and - tapes.

### Polarizability

It has been found experimentally that the amount of polarization induced, the dipole moment $\vec{p}$, is directly proportional to the magnitude of the electric field.

$$
\vec{p} = \alpha\vec{E}
$$
The constant $\alpha$ is the polarizability of the material.

### A Neutral Atom and a Point Charge

#### Step 1 

![[Pasted image 20250131141006.png]]

The point charge will cause the neutral atom to form into an induced dipole with dipole moment
$$
\vec{p_2} = \alpha\vec{E_1}
$$

#### Step 2

![[Pasted image 20250131141206.png]]
The polarized atom now has a dipole moment $p = q_2s$. This creates an electric field $\vec{E_2}$ at the location of the point charge. We can write the magnitude of $\vec{E_2}$ as:

$$
|\vec{E_2}|=E_2=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{2p}{r^3}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{2\alpha E_1}{r^3}
$$
Since we know $E_1$ which is the electric field of the point charge at the location of the dipole, we can plug it in.

$$
E_2=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{2\alpha E_1}{r^3}=(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{2\alpha}{r^3})(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1}{r^2})
$$
$$
=(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0})^2(\frac{2\alpha q_1}{r^5})
$$

#### Step 3

![[Pasted image 20250131141929.png]]
What is the force exerted on the point charge by the induced dipole?

$$
\vec{F_1} = q_1\vec{E_2}=q_1(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0})^2(\frac{2\alpha q_1}{r^5})\hat{r}=(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0})^2(\frac{2\alpha q_1^2}{r^5})\hat{r}
$$
Because of newton's third law we also know that

$$
\overrightarrow{F_2}=-\overrightarrow{F}_1=-\left(\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}\right)^2\left(\frac{2 \alpha q_1^2}{r^5}\right) \hat{r}
$$
### Interaction of Charged Objects and Neutral Matter

**Question**: try to explain in detail what happens when a positively charged tape is brought near your hand. 

The positively charged tape creates and electric field that induces a dipole in the neutral atoms in your hand as shown below. The induced dipoles in your hand create an electric field at the location of the tape which pulls the tape toward your hand.

## Polarization of Insulators

In insulators electrons are firmly bound to the atoms or molecules making up the material. In the figure below we show a solid block of insulating material where each molecule has been polarized by an electric field. The electric field has induced the normally unpolarized insulator to become polarized. In each molecule the electrons move a very short distance and form a dipole. 

![[Pasted image 20250131160136.png]]

### Important Notes

* Polarization happens very quickly.  The process can take much less than a nanosecond.
* Diagrams showing polarization of insulators show the extent of the polarization by varying how "stretched" the molecule is.
* Excess charge in an insulator stay where they are. Excess charge on the outside can be found on a particular place on the surface without spreading out along the surface.
* When atoms or molecules in an insulator polarize in response to an electric field the polarized molecules themselves make electric fields. We neglect this electric field because it is very small.

## Polarization of Conductors

Electrons in a conductor are free to move large distances.

### Drift Speed and Applied Electric Field

If a beaker of salt water is placed in a region where there is an electric field, a sodium ion or a chlorine ion will experience an electric force and will begin to move at a constant rate. The speed at which mobile charges move through a conductor is called **drift speed**. Drift speed is directly proportional to the magnitude of the electric field with a proportionality constant called the mobility constant $u$.

$$
\bar{v}=u E_{\text {net }}
$$
$\bar{v}$ is the average drift speed of a mobile charge
$u$ is the mobility of the charge. Units $\frac{m/s}{N/C}$.
$E_{net}$ is the magnitude of the net electric field at t he location of the mobile charge.


## Charge Motion in Metals

### The Mobile Electron Sea

The atoms in a solid piece of metal are arranged in a regular 3D geometric array called a **lattice**. the inner electrons are bound to the nucleus. Some join a "sea" of mobile electrons that are free to move throughout the entire piece of solid metal. 

![[Pasted image 20250131162905.png]]

### No Net Interaction Between Mobile Electrons

The net electric field inside a piece of metal in equilibrium is zero. In some ways it is useful to model them as an ideal gas.

### The Drude Model 

The classical model of electron motion called the Drude model explains that a mobile electron in metal under the influence of an electric field does accelerate and gain energy, but then it loses that energy by colliding with the with the lattice of atomic cores.

### Polarization Happens Quickly

When an electric field is applied to a metal, the metal polarizes. We can describe polarization as the entire mobile electron sea shifting relative to the fixed positive cores.

![[Pasted image 20250131163611.png]]

As seen in the image above due to the shift in the electron sea there is a thin negatively charged layer on the left and a thin positively charged layer on the right.
